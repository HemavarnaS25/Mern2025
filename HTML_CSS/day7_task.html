        <p>6. Why does accessing an object's property using the dot operator in a for-in loop return undefined?</p>
        <p style="color:blue;">Answer: It happens because the dot operator looks for a property named "key" instead of dynamically accessing the property corresponding to the variable's value.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>7. Why are there placeholders (three dots) in code examples for if...else and do...while?</p>
        <p style="color:blue;">Answer: The three dots (...) in such examples indicate omitted logic or code that should be added in those sections as needed.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>9. Why is Git known for its fast execution of commands?</p>
        <p style="color:blue;">Answer: Git is fast because it is implemented in the C programming language, which ensures high performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>10. What is the purpose of initializing a folder with Git?</p>
